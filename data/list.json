    "lyrics": "The Bhagavad Gita (Song of the Lord) is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the epic Mahabharata. It presents a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer, Lord Kṛsṇa.\n\nThe setting is the battlefield of Kuruksetra, just before the start of the great war between the Paṇḍavas and the Kauravas. Overwhelmed by moral dilemma and despair at the thought of fighting his own kinsmen, teachers, and friends, Arjuna refuses to fight.\n\nKṛsṇa then imparts transcendental knowledge, covering the principles of duty (Dharma), the nature of the soul (atman), devotion (Bhakti), action (Karma Yoga), and knowledge (Jñana Yoga). The 18 chapters of the Gita are often referred to as 18 Yogas (disciplines or paths to spiritual realization). The essence of the Gita is to encourage selfless action and devotion, regardless of worldly outcomes.",
